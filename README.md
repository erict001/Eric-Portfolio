# Eric Taylor's Portfolio

This project is my portfolio filled with our most recent group project, along with my two favorite assignments so far. This portfolio is designed to show off my abilities from our Coding Bootcamp so far.  

## Built With
This page I used:
• HTML
• CSS
• Javascript
• Bootstrap

## Description 

This project is designed to show off my favorite assignments and most recent group project so far. 


## Points of Interest

### Header
My header features an image of myself and my son. It is the most recent picture I have of myself even though it isn't considered a professional photo.  

### Downloadable Resume
If you click the button on my downloadable resume button, it pulls up a PDF file of my most recent resume. 

### About Me
In the about me section, I briefly describe myself and my previous career. I will be going more in depth as the class goes on but I wanted to spend more time improving my layout and making it more of a mobile-first layout. 

### Work
This section details my 3 best assignments so far along with my github page and deployed link to the cooresponding project. Each project has a screenshot within the container with hyperlinks in the text that takes you to each of the referenced pages. 

### Contact Me
This section provides the user all of my contact information including: personal cell phone number, my email address, github account, and current LinkedIn page. 

## Successes

I felt successful in changing my layout to make it a more mobile-friendly option. My goal is to add more styling features next round so it will be more representative of the developer that I would like to become.  

## Challenges

I initially tried to make a more mobile friendly site using bootstrap but struggled and decided to go with media queries to alter the layout for each screen type.
